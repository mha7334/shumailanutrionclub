                        <h3>Proteins:</h3>

                        <p>
                            Proteins are an important part of your bones, muscles, and skin. In fact, proteins are in every living cell in your body. Inside cells, proteins perform many functions, including:
                            Helping to break down food for energy
                            <ul>
                                <li>Helping to break down food for energy</li>
                                <li>
                                    Building structures
                                </li>
                                <li>Breaking down toxins</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                            
                            
                            Proteins are made up of building blocks called amino acids. Your body can make some amino acids but not others. Proteins that you get from meat and other animal products contain all the amino acids you need. These include both those your body can make and those it can't. Proteins from meat and other animal products are known as complete protein.
                            Proteins from plant products are incomplete proteins. That means that the proteins from one plant product don't contain all the amino acids your body needs. But another plant product may have the amino acids that the first one is missing. To get complete protein from plants, you need to eat a variety of plant foods. For instance, eating rice with beans or peanut butter with bread will give you complete protein.
                          
                            Good sources of protein include Fish and shellfish, Poultry, Red meat (beef, pork, lamb, Eggs, Nuts, Peanut butter, Nut butters, Seeds, Beans, Peas, Lentils, Soy products (tofu, tempeh, vegetarian burgers), Milk and Milk products (cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt)

                      <h3>Carbohydrates:</h3>

                      <p>
                            Carbohydrates are a primary fuel source for cells, especially the cells of the central nervous system and red blood cells. Muscles cells also rely on carbohydrates to fuel intense physical activity.
                             The foods we eat contain different types of carbohydrates. Some kinds are better for you than others. The different types of carbohydrates are:
							   <br>
							   <br> 
                        1. Sugars are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, milk, and milk products. Foods such as cakes and cookies have had sugars added. Table sugar also is an added sugar. All of these sugars can be converted in your body to glucose, or blood sugar. Your cells "burn" glucose for energy.
                           <br>
						2. Starches are broken down in your body into sugars. Starches are found in certain vegetables, such as potatoes, beans, peas, and corn. They are also found in breads, cereals, and grains.
                          <br>
					   3. Dietary fibers are carbohydrates that your body cannot digest. They pass through your body without being broken down into sugars. Even though your body does not get energy from fiber, you still need fiber to stay healthy. Fiber helps get rid of excess fats in the intestine, which helps prevent heart disease. Fiber also helps push food through the intestines, which helps prevent constipation. Foods high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and whole-grain foods (such as whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice).
                      <br>
					  <br>
					   Healthy carbohydrates include:
		  <ul>
                                <li>Natural sugars in fruits, vegetables, milk, and milk products</li>
                                <li>
                                 Dietary fiber  
                                </li>
                                <li>Starches in whole-grain foods, beans, peas, and corn</li>
                                
                            </ul>
					  <br>
					  To keep your blood glucose in check, limit the amount of table sugar you eat. Also, limit foods with added sugars. You can tell if a food has added sugars by looking at the ingredients list on the package
                      People who eliminate carbohydrates can experience side effects. Which include bad breath, ketoacidosis, constipation, fatigue and brain Fog, kidney, liver and bone Problems, Poor nutrition and increased Disease Risk.

         <h3>Fats:</h3>

                        <p>
                            Our body needs some fat to function properly.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fat is a source of energyy</li>
                                <li>
                                  Fat is used by your body to make substances it needs
                                </li>
                                <li>Fat helps your body absorb certain vitamins from food</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                            But not all fats are the same. Some are better for your health than others. To help prevent heart disease and stroke, most of the fats you eat should be monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that appear to reduce your risk of heart disease. Good sources of omega-3s are fatty fish. These include salmon, trout, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines.
							You can also get omega-3s from plant sources. These include ground flaxseed (linseed), flaxseed oil, and walnuts. Small amounts are also found in soybean and canola oils.
